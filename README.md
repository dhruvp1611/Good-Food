**Creamy Truffle Risotto**: Silky Arborio rice cooked to perfection, each bite infused with a rich, savory broth and aged Parmesan. Finished with a drizzle of fragrant truffle oil and topped with delicate shavings of black truffle. Garnished with fresh chives and a hint of cracked pepper, it's a luxurious blend of creamy, earthy flavors.
